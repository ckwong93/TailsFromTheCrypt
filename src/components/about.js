            <span className="about-text">
               In a nutshell, Cryptocurrencies are a new form of payments that can be used for transactions online. Unlike fiat currencies like Dollars and Euros,
               digital currencies are decentralized, anonymous, and instant. This means that these transactions have minimal fees, are untraceable, and transfer much faster than those of traditional currencies.
               <br></br><br></br>
              There are multiple reasons why these alternative currencies are disrupting the world. With a multitude of advantages and an ever-evolving ecosystem, now is the perfect time to
              dip your toes into cryptocurrency investment.

  The purpose of this site is to provide users with a simple and easy-to-understand resource for cryptocurrency and
  altcoins investment. Think of this as a starter kit towards jumpstarting your altcoin portfolio! Let's begin with a quick introduction
  to two of the most popular coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum.
               Most altcoins are either Bitcoin or Ethereum based. What this means is that they are built using the same technologies as their base,
               but provide unique services. Each individual altcoin provides a special service or interaction. For example, Golems provides supercomputing processing power,
               Ripple provides instantaneous bank transactions, and Civic provides Identity Verification and Protection. With thousands of altcoins out there,
               it's easy to get confused and lost. What we're trying to build here is a platform to learn, track, and understand some of these awesome altcoins!<br></br><br></br>
